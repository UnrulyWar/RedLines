    <p><span>W</span>hen American forces broke through German resistance in the spring of 1945, U.S. Army
commanders began to worry about rising reports of sexual violence. “Since the entry into
Germany by the Seventh Army the number of cases of rape have increased greatly,” General
Alexander Patch reported. “The situation is one in which it is believed emergency action is
required.”
1 Omar Bradley, commander of the largest group of armies on the continent, warned
</p>

<p>
General Dwight D. Eisenhower that “certain conditions of looting, pillaging, wanton destruc-
tion, rape and other crimes” were widespread.2 By the time of his writing, in April 1945, some

500 reports of rape per week were flooding into the Judge Advocate General’s office.
    </p>

    <p>
      An after-action report would later confirm these concerns: “We were members of a conquer-
      ing army and we came as conquerors. The rates of reported rapes sprang skyward.” This report

      acknowledged that many more rapes occurred than were reflected in general court-martial
      records, which listed 552 trials for Germany as a whole until the end of the war. </p>

      <p>The Judge

      Advocate said that not more than 25 percent of reported cases ever made it to trial.4 The sit-
      uation was “ripe for violent sex crimes,” the report concluded, and “the avalanche came.”
    </p>


    <p>
      The history of Allied sexual violence in Nazi Germany is a troubled one. Numerous histo-
      rians have documented the extensive sexual assaults that German women suffered at war’s end;

      in popular memory, this history is associated above all with the Soviet “Rape of Berlin,” though
      French and American troops were also regularly accused of gendered violence.

    </p>

    <p>After

      Germany’s defeat in 1945, such stories of sexual violation would be transformed into a mythol-
      ogy of national violation that was effectively racialized and put toward neo-fascist ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>  “We were members of a conquering army and we came as conquerors. The rates of reported rapes sprang skyward.”
      </blockquote>
      <p> This

      prospect was immediately discernible to black soldiers and journalists on the ground in

      Germany in the spring of 1945, who saw how the U.S. Army’s commitment to Jim Crow seg-
      regation—including prohibitions on sex and fraternization across the color line—aligned with pre-existing German fears of black men to create a situation in which African American GIs
could be disproportionately tried for and convicted of rape, even when their sexual encounters
were consensual.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was, after all, how the sexual color line had worked stateside, in the American South,
      where 80 percent of black GIs trained, as well as in Britain and France, where African American
      soldiers made up about 10 percent of total U.S. troop strength.
      <p>In France, the extent
        of racial scapegoating was especially staggering, as black GIs accounted for 77 percent of
        rape convictions, and army authorities, in unison with local French mayors, denounced
        what they called the “black terror on the Bocage.”

      </p>White American commanders
      worried incessantly about sexual encounters between black men and white women as African
      American demands for civil rights grew louder.
    </p>

    <p>Children born from interracial relationships,
      they feared, would undermine white supremacy and the black/white racial ordering of the
      United States. For this reason, the army policed sexual crimes (including consensual acts across

      the color line deemed criminal by miscegenation laws in the United States or by military reg-
      ulations in the European Theater) far more aggressively than other crimes. </p>

      <p>The weight of that

      power landed disproportionately on black soldiers, who were widely blamed for episodes of
      rape, and not infrequently sentenced to death on little or no evidence.
    </p>

    <p>In France, the extent
      of racial scapegoating was especially staggering, as black GIs accounted for 77 percent of
      rape convictions, and army authorities, in unison with local French mayors, denounced
      what they called the “black terror on the Bocage.”

    <p> Watching the same white supremacist

      dynamics endemic to the United States now playing out across the Atlantic, the NAACP com-
      plained that black soldiers were being “railroaded to prison,” while journalists involved in the

      Double V campaign described a process akin to legal lynching: as one correspondent for the
      Chicago Defender put it, “Death has become the penalty for crossing the color line.”
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the army entered Germany, the picture grew more complicated.

    </p>

    <p>As reports of rape
      increased, the claims were more clearly tied to combat troops on the tip of the spear, not the
      supporting units at the rear, where most African American troops had been shunted into
      menial jobs. In other words, army commanders were faced with substantive evidence that
      those responsible for this latest spate of violence were overwhelmingly white.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonetheless, U.S. military officials at first tried to assign primary blame for sexual crimes in
      Germany to black soldiers. Many of the cases that occurred during the invasion, ventured one report,
      were caused “by negro troops in convoys en route back from the front.”

    </p>

    <p>Common racist assump-
      tions held by many white Americans and Europeans alike—that rape was something black men

      “couldn’t help,” as one woman put it in a letter to the director of the NAACP—further enabled
      such scapegoating.13 As one German woman explained to a court-martial, “It was best not to resist
      [black soldiers]; otherwise we would be killed. Everybody talked about that.”
    </p>
  <p>
      While sexual violence by black men was portrayed as something inherent and uncontrolla-
      ble, it was simultaneously rendered exceptional for white men, an aberration triggered by their

      exposure to war. This was the case for Clayton Austin, a white GI who perpetrated at least six
      assaults against three teenage girls in the midst of battle.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "White soldiers’ sexual violence was perceived as excusable and unremarkable, while black men’s...was treated as a deeper injury that warranted the harshest punishment."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The Staff Judge Advocate, the legal
      advisor for Austin’s division, condemned Austin’s “violent and lustful course of conduct”
      and referred him for psychiatric testing, concluding that he must have lost his mind. Even
      Austin’s victims appealed for clemency for him, stating their belief that “this incident would
      never have occurred had he not been intoxicated, the blame for which can be put on the
      war.”

    </p>

    <p> Watching these disparate narratives develop, the Chicago Defender decried such a “dou-
      ble standard of morals” by which white soldiers’ sexual violence was perceived as excusable and

      unremarkable, while black men’s purported sexual aggression was treated as a deeper injury

      that warranted the harshest punishment. The true crime here, argued the leading black news-
      paper, was the extension of Jim Crow overseas and into “the field of sex.”
    </p>



    <p>
      Nevertheless, the army’s efforts to racialize sexual crimes in Germany ultimately proved less
      successful than they had been elsewhere, leading to an unexpectedly steep and sudden decline
      in prosecutions of black soldiers. As German women were called upon to testify in American

      courts, they emphasized their helplessness in the face of a conquering army, ultimately convinc-
      ing Army legal officials that almost all sexual encounters between occupier and occupied could

      constitute rape.
    </p>

    <p> During one trial, a woman challenged the prevailing assumption that only
      evidence of a physical struggle could substantiate a charge of rape by posing the question:
      “what does force mean?”

    </p>

        <p> In another case, when Greta Schmitz was asked whether she “will-
      fully consent[ed] to any of the acts of intercourse,” she responded bluntly: “That is a dumb

      question.”
    </p>

    <p>If she wanted sex, she said, she could have just “taken a German soldier.”
    </p>

    <p> This,
      she insisted, was rape, and the court should not require physical evidence to prove it; structural
      conditions, the obvious vulnerability of German women to an invading army, should have been
      sufficient.

    <p>
        German women’s testimony in American courts ultimately convinced army legal officials
        that an enemy soldier was frightening, no matter his race.

      </p>
      <p>
        As one judge advocate put it, “a
        man who enters a strange house, carrying a loaded rifle in one hand, is not justified in believing
        that he has accomplished a seduction on the other hand.”

      </p>

      <p>This kind of language was unheard
        of in military courts elsewhere in Europe; ironically, it had resonance in Germany only because

        German women were enemies, and were therefore justified in their belief that American weap-
        ons might be used against them.
      </p>
      <p>
        French and British women, as allies, were not entitled to hold

        the same fear when encountering white American soldiers.
      </p>

      <p> As legal officials began to take seri-
        ously German women’s claims of rape against white men, they struggled to uphold the color

        line in ways they previously had.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, white soldiers received almost three times as
        many convictions for rape as they had in France.

      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As legal officials began to take German women’s claims seriously, they struggled to uphold the color line
        </blockquote>
      <p>

      Rather than facing the prospect of hundreds of white American soldiers imprisoned for
assaulting German women, and fearing a public outcry back in the United States, the
Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson pushed for universal clemency, warning that he did

not want the War Department to be “flooded with demands for immediate reduction in sen-
tences in cases where they cannot be defended.”
</p>
<p>
At the end of the hostilities, the Army
Clemency Board revoked the death sentences of all soldiers convicted of rape in Germany
and reduced the prison sentences of many more.

</p>
<p>Black soldiers benefitted from this policy
even though it was not intended for them.
</p>

<p>From their perspective, the encounter between
white American commanding officers and German, potentially Nazi, women revealed that
the bonds of whiteness often transcended wartime enmity.

</p>
<p> Nonetheless, it was the objections
of these same enemy women that worked to undermine the color line in wartime Europe,
which, for a time at least, had cracked under the weight of too many countervailing
assumptions.
